    "\"The New York Times Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States. It has been published weekly in The New York Times Book Review since October 12, 1931. In the 21st century, it has evolved into multiple lists, grouped by genre and format, including fiction and non-fiction, hardcover, paperback and electronic.\" (Wikipedia)\n",

    "In this project, we will be interested in the following list, which started in 2011 and cover the last 10 years of best sellers:\n",
    "- Combined Print & E-Book Fiction\n",
    "- Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction\n",
    "\n",
    "### The API\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain the data from the NYT, we need to extract it from their website. Luckily, The New York Times provides an easy to use [API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) that can be used to pull data from their website including the best sellers list. The only limitation of their API is a limit of 4,000 requests per day and 10 requests per minute. This means that we have to sleep 6 seconds between calls to avoid hitting the per minute rate limit. Considering that we want to pull 10 years of weekly data from two lists, this equates to 1040 calls taking 6 seconds each. The total time to collect the data will therefore be roughly 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we will be collecting was published from 2011-02-13 to 2021-05-23. For the first 6 years, until 2017-01-29, the list consisted of 20 books per week, but was reduced to 15 books in the following editions. The list also accounts for data collected 15 days prior to the list being published. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data itself comes with the following information:\n",
    "- **rank** - The current ranking of the book\n",
    "- **rank last week** - What rank it was the previous week\n",
    "- **weeks on list** - How many weeks it appeared on the list\n",
    "- **primary_isbn10** - The main ISBN10\n",
    "- **primary_isbn10** - The main ISBN13\n",
    "- **publisher** - The name of the publisher\n",
    "- **description** - Brief description of the book\n",
    "- **title** - The title\n",
    "- **author** - The auhtor\n",
    "- **bestsellers date** - When the data was collected\n",
    "- **published date** - When the list was published\n",
    "\n",
    "A few more information appear on the data obtained from the NYT, such as a \"dagger\" columns that marks if an entry has made the list in suspicious ways such as bulk purchases. However, for this project we will not worry about this and consider everything on the list.\n",

Unfortunately, Goodreads doesn't provide new users with an API anymore so to obtain the genre we will have to scrape it from their website.\n",

There are a few hundred missing ISBNs where for some of them they have used their internal id number, while others are not recognized by Goodreads and some don't even have an ISBN (most often because they were self published on amazon). Therefore, there's a lot of cleaning work to do.\n",
