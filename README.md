# Trend Analysis of the New York Times Best Sellers

This project's goal is to determine if there are any identifiable trends and patterns in the books that appear in The New York Times Best Sellers list.
Mainly, I'll be focusing on genre, trying to determine what are the popular genres and if there are any trends that can help us
understand what will be popular in the future.

**In this project:**
- I pull data from the NYT Books API
- I scrape Goodreads for genre
- I visualize trends with Tableau
- I analyse trends

**Files:**
- `NYT Best Sellers - Trend Analysis.ipynb`: Main document for the whole project
